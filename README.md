# CyVerse-NEON-AOP Workshop
Python Jupyter Notebook tutorials for working with NEON AOP data in CyVerse VICE.

Notebooks in this repository will run in the [JupyterLab_Geospatial_2.2.9](https://de.cyverse.org/apps/de/5eb08814-6b1a-11eb-9180-008cfa5ae621/launch) CyVerse Discovery Environment.

1) The `aop_data_download` folder includes a lesson and functions for downloading data from the NEON API using Python.
2) The `hyperspectral` folder includes lessons in Python for reading in, visualizing, and working with NEON AOP Hyperspectral data. Notebooks starting with `GEE` use the Google Earth Engine Python API (packages `ee` and `geemap`) to visualize and work with AOP data uploaded to Google Earth Engine.
